# Highlights

# Requirements

- Python 3
- Computing power (high-end GPU) and memory space (both RAM/GPU's RAM) is **extremely important** if you'd like to train your own model.
- Required packages and their use are listed:
```
apex             # non-essential, faster optimization (only needed if enabled in config)
editdistance     # error rate calculation
joblib           # parallel feature extraction & decoding
librosa          # feature extraction (for feature extraction only)
pandas           # data management
sentencepiece    # sub-word unit encoding (for feature extraction only, see https://github.com/google/sentencepiece#build-and-install-sentencepiece for install instruction)
tensorboardX     # logger & monitor
torch            # model & learning
tqdm             # verbosity
yaml             # config parser
mmsdk            # sentiment dataset CMU-MOSI SDK (sentiment data preprocessing only, see https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK#installation for install instruction)
```

# Instructions

***Before you start, make sure all the packages required listed above are installed correctly***

## Step 0. Preprocessing - Acoustic Feature Extraction & Text Encoding

See the instructions on the [Preprocess wiki page](https://github.com/andi611/Mockingjay-Speech-Representation-Learning/wiki/Mockingjay-Preprocessing-Instructions) for preprocessing instructions.

## Step 1. Configuring - Model Design & Hyperparameter Setup

All the parameters related to training/decoding will be stored in a yaml file. Hyperparameter tuning and massive experiment and can be managed easily this way. See [config files](config/) for the exact format and examples.

## Step 2. Training the Mockingjay Model for Speech Representation Learning

Once the config file is ready, run the following command to train unsupervised end-to-end Mockingjay:
```bash
python3 runner_mockingjay.py --train
```
All settings will be parsed from the config file automatically to start training, the log file can be accessed through TensorBoard.

## Step 3. Loading Pre-trained Models and Testing

Once a model was trained, run the following command to test the generated representations:
```bash
python3 runner_mockingjay.py --load --test_phone
```
Pre-trained models and their configs can be download from [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tZQnT8y7sE6kuxVWivo-KmRw8CgLy7da?usp=sharing).
To load with default path, models should be placed under the directory path: `--ckpdir=./result_mockingjay/` and name the model file manually with `--ckpt=`.

## Step 4. Loading Pre-trained Models and Visualize
Run the following command to visualize the model generated samples:
```bash
# visualize spectrogram
python3 runner_mockingjay.py --plot
# visualize hidden representations
python3 runner_mockingjay.py --plot --with-head
```
Note that the arguments ```--ckpdir=XXX --ckpt=XXX``` needs to be set correctly for the above command to run properly.

## Step 5. Monitor Training Log
```bash
# open TensorBoard to see log
tensorboard --logdir=log/log_mockingjay/mockingjay_libri_sd1337/
# or
python3 -m tensorboard.main --logdir=log/log_mockingjay/mockingjay_libri_sd1337/
```

## Experiments - Application on downstream tasks

## Experiments - Compare with APC
See the instructions on the [APC wiki page](https://github.com/andi611/Mockingjay-Speech-Representation-Learning/wiki/Reproducing-APC-to-compare-with-Mockingjay) to reproduce our experiments.
